## 1. General Terms and Conditions
All purchases are accepted and carried out exclusively on the basis of these terms and conditions of the organiser, the Bildungswerk des Verbandes Deutscher Tonmeister GmbH (hereinafter referred to as BiW-vdt GmbH). Deviating conditions of the customer have no validity. With his purchase, the customer acknowledges these conditions. Additional agreements are only legally binding if they have been confirmed in writing by the organiser (BiW-vdt GmbH). Special regulations do not invalidate the remaining conditions. The purchase of tickets for the purpose of resale is generally prohibited.
The BiW-vdt GmbH uses the electronic ticket system "Pretix" for the sale of tickets.
The BiW-vdt GmbH uses the company "PayPal" as payment provider.
The customer must be a trade visitor. 
The tickets are personalised and only valid in conjunction with an official photo ID.
Only conference tickets entitle the holder to attend the conference programme.
Exhibition tickets do not give access to the lecture programme. 
If the max. If the maximum capacity of a lecture room is reached, a congress ticket does not entitle the holder to attend this lecture. Note: Attention is drawn to the need to arrive in good time.

## 2. Offers and Prices
Offers and prices are always subject to change. Prices lose their validity with the appearance of a new price list. Our prices include the statutory value added tax.  
Concessionary tickets for schoolchildren, apprentices or students are only available to persons up to and including 35 years of age.

## 3. Purchase, Invoicing
By purchasing tickets online, the online ticketing customer declares his or her consent to the online ticket being transmitted and to the invoice being issued electronically. There is no entitlement to invoicing by paper invoice document. 
The exchange and return or refund of tickets is not possible.
Lost tickets will not be replaced.
Pursuant to § 312 b III No. 6 of the German Civil Code (BGB), ticket purchases on the Internet are not subject to the rules on distance contracts. Therefore, there is no right of withdrawal according to § 355 BGB. All purchases are therefore final and binding.

## 4. Terms of Payment
Payment for online tickets is made by PayPal when purchased. External service providers are used to process the payment.
If a payment is charged back (e.g. due to insufficient funds in the account specified when the order was placed), the participant must compensate any damage or expenses arising from the charge back. This includes in particular the bank charges as well as a processing fee of EUR 10.00 per chargeback for processing by the organiser (BiW-vdt GmbH).
In the event of a chargeback, the organiser (BiW-vdt GmbH) is entitled to withdraw from the contract immediately. The participant thereby loses his/her right to participate in the event. Further claims of the organiser (BiW-vdt GmbH) against the participants are not affected by this.

## 5. Data Protection
The personal data of the buyer collected during the online purchase will be handled in accordance with the DSGVO. The data protection statements of Pretix and PayPal are part of these GTC:  
https://pretix.eu/about/de/privacy  
https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full  
An anonymised QR code is printed on each ticket. With the respective consent of the customer, this can be scanned by exhibitors to conveniently save the conversation contact (name, the email address and the country) via an app.

## 6. Images and Sound recordings
The customer agrees for all known and unknown types of use in all media, free of charge and unlimited in time and place, that BiW-vdt GmbH or third parties commissioned by BiW-vdt GmbH are entitled to to make image and/or sound recordings of him/her in the context of the event and to use, edit and, also in edited form, reproduce, distribute, exhibit, make publicly accessible and archive them in whole or in part for editorial reporting as well as for marketing and advertising purposes for the event and BiW-vdt GmbH on a non-commercial and commercial basis.

## 7. Unforeseen Events
BiW-vdt GmbH is entitled to postpone, shorten, terminate or cancel the physical conference in whole or in part or to change the content appropriately, taking into account the interests of the participants, in the event of compelling reasons for which BiW-vdt GmbH is not responsible (e.g. industrial disputes, official or statutory orders) or force majeure (e.g. extreme weather conditions, catastrophes, war, terrorist threat, fire, danger to the life or health of the participants).
BiW-vdt GmbH shall not be liable for expenses or damages in the event of a change to the event within the above-mentioned scope (including cancellation, postponement, shortening).
In the event of cancellation of the event, the admission fees will be refunded without system fees upon presentation of the original ticket.

## 8. Liability
BiW-vdt GmbH shall be liable without limitation for damages to the customer only if these are attributable to its intentional or grossly negligent conduct. In the case of slightly negligent breaches of duty BiW-vdt GmbH shall only be liable in the event of a breach of one of its essential contractual duties (cardinal duty). In this case the liability of BiW-vdt GmbH is limited to the direct damage of the customer which is typical for the contract and foreseeable at the time of conclusion of the contract. This also applies to breaches of duty by legal representatives and/or vicarious agents of BiW-vdt GmbH. Liability for culpable injury to life, body or health remains unaffected by this limitation of liability.
Further links may lead to Internet providers whose content is not the responsibility of BiW-vdt GmbH. These links are recognisable as such from the context or are marked separately. BiW-vdt GmbH has no influence whatsoever on the content provided there and does not adopt this content as its own. In particular, BiW-vdt GmbH expressly distances itself from the statements that can be called up there. 

Moreover, responsibility can only be established if BiW-vdt GmbH has knowledge of legal infringements and it is technically possible and reasonable for BiW-vdt GmbH to prevent their use (§ 8 para. 2 TMG). BiW-vdt GmbH has checked the external content for possible legal infringements to a reasonable extent. Violations of copyright, trademark or personal rights or infringements of competition law on the websites of third-party providers were not apparent and are not known to us, nor are any criminal offences committed there. The provider of these pages alone is liable for contents and damages resulting from the use or non-use of information presented in this way, and not the party who merely refers to the respective publication via links. This restriction also applies equally to third-party entries in guest books, discussion forums and mailing lists set up by BiW-vdt GmbH.

## 9. Special Covid-19 Provisions when visiting the physical Fair
All customers/participants must comply with the regulations applicable to the event (e.g. negative proofs, distance and hygiene regulations), which are based on the Coronavirus Protection Ordinance (CoSchuV) of the Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia relevant at the time of the event or corresponding official requirements.

## 10. Other Provisions, Severability Clause
Should individual provisions of the contract with the customer, including these GTC, be or become invalid in whole or in part, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions. The wholly or partially invalid provision shall be replaced by a provision which comes as close as possible to the economic purpose of the invalid provision in a legally permissible manner. The same applies to the filling of any contractual gaps.
The provisions of German law shall apply exclusively.
The exclusive place of jurisdiction for fully qualified merchants, for persons who do not have a general place of jurisdiction in Germany, as well as for persons who have moved their place of residence or habitual abode abroad after conclusion of the contract or whose place of residence or habitual abode is unknown at the time the action is brought, shall be the registered office of BiW-vdt GmbH in Baden-Baden.
