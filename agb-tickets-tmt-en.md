**General Terms and Conditions (GTC) and Privacy Notice for Online Ticketing (Electronic Purchase of Admission Tickets) for the 33rd Tonmeistertagung 2025 (tmt33) in Düsseldorf**  
Effective Date: September 16, 2025

## 1. General Provisions
All purchases are accepted and fulfilled solely under these terms and conditions issued by the organizer, Bildungswerk des Verbandes Deutscher Tonmeister GmbH (hereinafter referred to as "BiW-vdt GmbH"). Deviating conditions of the customer shall not apply. By making a purchase, the customer acknowledges and agrees to these terms and conditions. Additional agreements are only legally binding if confirmed in writing by the organizer (BiW-vdt GmbH). Special arrangements do not override the other provisions. The purchase of tickets for the purpose of resale is strictly prohibited.  
BiW-vdt GmbH utilizes the electronic ticketing system "Pretix" for ticket sales.  
BiW-vdt GmbH uses the companies "Stripe" and "PayPal" as payment service providers. Customers must be trade visitors. Tickets are personalized and valid only when presented together with an official photo ID. Only congress tickets grant access to the conference program. Exhibition-only tickets do not grant access to the conference sessions. If the maximum capacity of a conference room is reached, possession of a congress ticket does not guarantee entry to that particular session. Note: Timely arrival is strongly advised.

## 2. Offers and Prices
All offers and prices are subject to change without notice. Prices become invalid upon the release of a new price list. All prices include applicable statutory VAT.  
Discounted tickets for pupils, apprentices, or students are only available to individuals up to and including 35 years of age.

## 3. Purchase and Invoicing
By purchasing tickets online, the customer agrees to receive both the ticket and the invoice electronically. There is no entitlement to a paper invoice. Tickets are non-refundable and non-exchangeable. Lost tickets will not be replaced. Pursuant to § 312 b III Nr. 6 of the German Civil Code (BGB), online ticket purchases do not fall under distance selling regulations. Therefore, there is no statutory right of withdrawal under § 355 BGB. All purchases are final and binding.

## 4. Payment Terms
External service providers (PayPal, STRIPE) are used to process payments. In the event of a payment reversal (e.g., due to insufficient funds), the participant shall be liable for all resulting damages and costs, including bank charges and a processing fee of EUR 10.00 per reversal charged by the organizer (BiW-vdt GmbH). In the case of a payment reversal, the organizer (BiW-vdt GmbH) reserves the right to immediately withdraw from the contract. The participant will then lose the right to attend the event. Additional claims by the organizer (BiW-vdt GmbH) remain unaffected.

## 5. Data Protection
The buyer's personal data collected during the online purchase will be treated in accordance with the GDPR and will be stored, processed, and, if necessary, passed on to payment service providers or the KombiTicket partner exclusively in direct connection with the purchase of an admission ticket. The privacy policies of Pretix, Stripe, PayPal, and RIDE are an integral part of these terms and conditions:

+ [https://ride-ticketing.de/Datenschutz](https://ride-ticketing.de/Datenschutz) (german)

An anonymised QR code is printed on each name badge. With the customer's consent, this can be scanned by exhibitors to conveniently save the contact details (name, email address, voluntary additional information on the name badge, country) via an app (LEAD scanning).  
Exhibitors have the option of issuing vouchers for the free generation of tickets. Personal data (name, email address, voluntary additional information on the name badge, country) collected through the use of these vouchers is available to the issuing exhibitor for further use.  
The exhibitor is responsible for the further processing, storage and use of the data collected in the aforementioned ways in accordance with data protection regulations. The exhibitor will provide information on data processing.

## 6. Consent to Audio and Visual Recordings and Their Use
The customer agrees that audio and/or visual recordings of their person may be made during the event by BiW-vdt GmbH or third parties commissioned by it.

The customer grants irrevocable, royalty-free, and unlimited (in terms of time, geography, and content) consent for these recordings to be used in all currently known and future media and formats. This includes, in particular, editing, reproduction, distribution, exhibition, public access, archiving, as well as publication and use for editorial, documentary, promotional, and commercial purposes – both in connection with the event and for the general public relations and marketing of BiW-vdt GmbH.

The consent applies to both original and edited versions, regardless of the storage medium or transmission method (e.g., print, online, social media, television, streaming, etc.).

## 7. Unforeseen Events / Force Majeure
BiW-vdt GmbH is entitled to reschedule, shorten, cancel, or reasonably modify the content of the event, in whole or in part, due to compelling circumstances beyond its control (e.g., official orders, legal requirements, strikes, failure of essential services) or due to force majeure (e.g., natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, fire, war, terrorist threats, epidemics/pandemics, or other threats to the life and safety of participants).

In such cases, no claims for damages or reimbursement of expenses can be asserted against BiW-vdt GmbH.

If the event is fully canceled for any of the reasons stated above, already paid participation fees will be refunded – excluding system and other presale fees – upon presentation of the original ticket.

## 8. Liability
BiW-vdt GmbH shall be liable for damages to the customer only in cases of intent or gross negligence.

In cases of slight negligence involving essential contractual obligations (cardinal duties), BiW-vdt GmbH's liability is limited to the typical, foreseeable, and direct damage under the contract. Cardinal duties are obligations whose fulfillment is essential for the proper execution of the contract and on whose observance the customer regularly relies.

These liability limitations also apply to breaches of duty by legal representatives or agents of BiW-vdt GmbH. Liability for injury to life, body, or health remains unaffected.

Disclaimer for Event Content  
The content of the event is prepared and delivered with the utmost care. However, no warranty is provided regarding its accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or usability. The event does not constitute individualized consulting.

Use of the information provided is at the participant’s own risk. BiW-vdt GmbH shall not be liable for any damage or disadvantage arising from reliance on or application of the content, subject to the aforementioned liability rules.

Disclaimer for violations of the GDPR by exhibitors  
BiW-vdt GmbH is not liable for violations of the GDPR resulting from the further processing, storage, and use of personal data collected by an exhibitor (LEAD scanning).

Disclaimer for External Content (Links)  
BiW-vdt GmbH’s websites and supporting materials for the event may contain links to third-party websites. BiW-vdt GmbH has no control over the content of such external websites and accepts no liability for them.

At the time of linking, the external content was checked within a reasonable scope for possible legal violations and no illegal content was apparent. Continuous content monitoring of linked websites without specific evidence of legal violations is unreasonable. If any infringements become known, such links will be promptly removed.

Only the provider of the linked page is liable for any damages resulting from the use or non-use of such content.

This limitation also applies to third-party entries in guest books, discussion forums, and mailing lists set up by BiW-vdt GmbH.

## 9. Miscellaneous / Severability Clause
Should any provision of this contract, including these General Terms and Conditions, be or become wholly or partially invalid or unenforceable, the validity of the remaining provisions shall remain unaffected.

The invalid or unenforceable provision shall be replaced by a legally permissible provision that most closely reflects the economic intent of the original. The same applies in cases of contractual omissions.

The laws of the Federal Republic of Germany shall apply exclusively, excluding the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG).

The place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from or in connection with this contract shall be Baden-Baden. This applies especially to contracts with merchants, legal entities under public law, or special funds under public law, as well as to individuals who do not have a general place of jurisdiction in Germany or who relocate their domicile or habitual residence abroad after the contract is concluded or whose residence is unknown at the time of legal action.
